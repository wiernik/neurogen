This repository contains code for validating the LENA and ACLEW algorithms on our daylong recordings collected in kids across neurodevelopmental profiles.
The first part is dedicated to comparing LENA and ACLEW across their key metrics. The second parts aim at evaluating existing vocal maturity classifiers (canonical, non-canonical, cries, laughs) against human annotations.
